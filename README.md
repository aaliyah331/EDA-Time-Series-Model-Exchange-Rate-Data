This project explores and forecasts exchange rate trends using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Modeling. Developed entirely in VS Code, it uses libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels to uncover seasonality, trends, and predictive insights.

Project Objectives; Clean and analyze historical exchange rate data -- Visualize patterns, trends, and anomalies -- Apply time series models (e.g., ARIMA) for forecasting -- Evaluate model performance and residuals

Tools & Libraries; Python 3.x -- pandas, numpy – data wrangling -- matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization -- statsmodels, scikit-learn – modeling and evaluation -- datetime – time series handling -- Developed in Visual Studio Code

File Structure; exchange_rate_model.ipynb or .py – Core analysis notebook or script -- data/exchange_rates.csv – Time series dataset -- plots/ – (Optional) Visual outputs (line plots, decomposition, forecasts)

How to Run; Clone the repository -- Install dependencies -- Run the notebook or script

Key Features; Line plot of currency movements over time -- Rolling mean and volatility bands -- Seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals) -- ARIMA or other models for forecasting -- Evaluation using RMSE, MAPE, residual diagnostics
